### Welcome to my profile!

My love for videogames has brought me to immerse myself in the world of Game Programming and since I found it I have been fascinated. 
I love working on games and creating experiences for people to enjoy.
I consider myself to be a great team player and love bouncing off ideas with others to get the best version of a product as possible.

My grreatest strenght is my communication skills and teamwork, which makes the dram work!

I am versed in C++ lenguage and I have worked on both Gameplay and Engine programming, highlighting the development of a full on Game Engine from scratch.

I have previously worked as Junior Gameplay Programmer at Crytek for 2 and a half years, where I made several changes to gameplay mechanics and engine features.
